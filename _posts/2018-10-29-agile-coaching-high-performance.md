## Preamble
Continued professional development (CPD) involves applying, learning and getting feedback from your day to day skills set, in order to excel achieve success. 

Being a technical lead involves applying a variety of skills set, ranging from technical, all the way through to being equipped with the softer skills to effectively manage and lead a development team. Nowadays, i find myself focusing more on coaching as much as anything else, to help achieve team success. I will be describing in this blog how you might effectively coach an agile team to expect high performance. 

This blog will be inspired from the reading of a book that was highly recommended by Scrum Masters and Agile Coaches online  [Coaching Agile Teams: Lyssa Adkins](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Coaching-Agile-Teams-ScrumMasters-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321637704/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1533026371&sr=8-1&keywords=coaching+agile+teams).  Thanks to Carfinance 247 for purchasing a couple of copies, which are available to read in the Library.

## Introduction
One of the key expectations for delivering success using agile techniques is to demand high performance. This post will discuss the characteristics which collectively subscribe to the efforts of delivering successful sprints, from sprint planning through to retrospectives, and all mid-sprint activities in between.


## Set the Expectation


It may sound surprising, but expecting high performance can be achieved without necessarily demanding it. The idea of effectively coaching a team to be highly performing, delivering features conforming to specification, and holding the team themselves accountable for that performance success is more than achievable.

As a coach, fundamentally, **you have to believe in high performance to achieve it**, and deliver a message to strive for success, propelling the team forward sprint after sprint, release by release. By subscribing to your own expectation, you enact the team to do the same, and coach individuals by giving them the raw materials needed to achieve and deliver, time after time.


## High Performance Tree

A key metaphor which is illustrated below as enacting high performance is used in the form of a performance tree[1].

```

An illustration of a high performance tree, serves to act as a reminder of the guiding principles, which collectively describe what needs to be encouraged in an agile team. 

> **Note:**
> The introduction of a high performance tree can be at any stage.
> The underlying message is that high performance, as in the metaphor of
> a tree, begins at grass roots level. Get the foundation right to
> create strong roots. Creating strong roots enables the tree to grow
> tall, the leaves absorb and gather enough light to yield fruits, these
> are fruits of high performance.[2]

As like me, if you struggle to always remember definitions, i always find a mnemonic or acronym helps, here I have coined the term F.O.R.C.E used to describe the key attributes of a high performing tree;

•	**F**ocus,  on the work you have committed to
•	**O**peness, by keeping everything to the team visible and transparent 
•	**R**espect, individuals by their background and experiences who collectively comprise a team
•	**C**ommitment, willingly to a goal. Scrum provides authority needed to meet commitments
•	**E**n- Courage, yourself to commit, act and be open, and to expect respect[3]


## Collaboration with High Performance
Once a team has flourished to the metaphor of a high performing tree, that team will itself be subject to becoming an inviting place for collaboration, individuals within the team will notice developments of their own skills set as a derivative of achieving high performance, compromising such as the following; [4]

•	Self organising rather than governed by role and / or title.
•	Empowered to make decisions
•	Truly believe as a team any problem can be solved.
•	Committed to team success above all else.
•	Decisions and commitments are owned by the team.
•	Motivated by Trust vs. fear or anger.
•	Consensus-driven, divergence following convergence.
•	Live in a world of constant constructive disagreement.

These characteristics can be further encapsulated in the below illustration.

## Conclusion
High performance, the results of a team’s high performance, is a journey. A team may reach a level of high performance, or continue to keep performing highly, but it never an “arrived” state, the journey continues.

Almost certainly, when a team has reached a high performance level, invariably, challenges and obstacles will get in the way which will act as a disruption. The importance is to engage, apply and learn / feedback from the principles of high performance described above, and by individuals collaborating to set their own expectations to commit to.
