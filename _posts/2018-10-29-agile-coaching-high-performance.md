## Preamble
As part of my continued professional development (CPD) here a CarFinance 247, I have undertaken the reading of a book that was highly recommended by Scrum Masters and Agile Coaches online  [Coaching Agile Teams: Lyssa Adkins](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Coaching-Agile-Teams-ScrumMasters-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321637704/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1533026371&sr=8-1&keywords=coaching+agile+teams). 

As a result, I will be posting a series of blogs on how Agile Coaching can be an effective means within teams, and using examples and references from the book. In this post, I will be discussing how we can achieve high performance within our Agile teams. Thanks to Carfinance 247 for purchasing a couple of copies, which are available to read in the Library.

## Introduction
One of the key endeavours and expectations for delivery success using agile techniques such as SCRUM is to demand high performance. This article will deep into the characteristics which collectively subscribe to the efforts of delivering successful sprints, whether it be from drive meaningful planning ceremonies, sprint close activities such as retrospectives all the way though to mid-sprint activities.

A slight twist I have introduced in the blog is the use of a mnemonic, for which I have used to coin some of the key principles (and altered one slightly to make the mnemonic sound memorable). The mnemonic in question is F.O.R.C.E and we will go into this in more detail further into the blog.



## Set the Expectation


It may sound surprising, but expecting high performance can be achieved without necessarily demanding it. The idea of effectively coaching a team to be highly performing, delivering features conforming to specification, and holding the team themselves accountable for the performance and achievement expectations is more than possible.

As a coach or someone coaching / mentoring a team, fundamentally, you have to believe in high performance to achieve it, and deliver a message to strive for success, propelling the team forward sprint after sprint, release by release. By subscribing to your own expectation, you enact the team to do the same, and coach individuals by giving them the raw materials needed to achieve and deliver high performance.


## High Performance Tree

A key metaphor which is illustrated and visualised as gauging high performance is in the form of a tree.

An illustration of a high performance tree, wherever it be plastered, is there to act as a reminder of the guiding principles which collectively describe what needs to be encouraged to deliver high performance in an agile team. Below is an illustration[1] for which we will further dig deeper into;

Note: The introduction of a high performance tree can be at any stage. The underlying message is that high performance, as in the metaphor of a tree, begins at grass roots level. Get the foundation right to create strong roots. Creating strong roots enables the tree to grow tall, the leaves absorb and gather enough light to yield fruits, these are fruits of high performance.[2]

As like me, if you struggle to always remember definitions, i always find a mnemonic or acronym helps, here I have coined the term F.O.R.C.E used to describe the key attributes of a high performing tree;

•	Focus,  on the work you have committed to
•	Openess, by keeping everything to the team visible and transparent 
•	Respect, individuals by their background and experiences who collectively comprise a team
•	Commitment, willingly to a goal. Scrum provides authority needed to meet commitments
•	En- Courage, yourself to commit, act and be open, and to expect respect[3]


## Collaboration with High Performance
Once a team has flourished to the metaphor of a high performing tree, prospering to becoming an inviting place for collaboration, individuals should and will notice developments of their own characteristics, compromising as the following; [4]

•	Self organising rather than governed by role and / or title.
•	Empowered to make decisions
•	Truly believe as a team any problem can be solved.
•	Committed to team success above all else.
•	Decisions and commitments are owned by the team.
•	Motivated by Trust vs. fear or anger.
•	Consensus-driven, divergence following convergence.
•	Live in a world of constant constructive disagreement.

## Conclusion
High performance, the results of a team’s high performance, is a journey. A team may reach a level of high performance, or continue to keep performing highly, but it never an “arrived” state, the journey continues.

Almost certainly, when a team has reached a high performance level, invariably, challenges and obstacles will get in the way which will act as a disruption. The importance is to engage, apply and learn / feedback from the principles of high performance described above, and by individuals collaborating to set their own expectations to commit to.
