## Preamble
Carfinance 247 squads operate using a SCRUM technique. More information on SCRUM can be found [here](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum) [1]. The following post describes an effective approach to time-boxing the core components involved during a session and what is involved briefly.

## Introduction
The planning session can essentially be broken down into 3 key components (In order of sequence)
-	Sprint Close [30 - 45 mins]
-	Retrospective (optional as is recommended at least every couple of sprints) [30 - 45 mins]
-	Sprint Planning [60 - 90 mins]
	
The times of these can sessions vary on the duration of the sprint, the assumption has been made that the sprint period is 2 weeks (inclusive of planning)

## Sprint Review


The idea of the sprint review is to for the team to demonstrate the shippable increment of product features during the sprint period. These are considered informal and preparation time time-boxed. During the sprint review the team identity the achievement of the sprint goals. Chaired by the Scrum Master or another member of the team. Invitees are the Scrum Team and stakeholders invited by the product owner). The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog, likely target and delivery dates based on progress to date (if needed);

## Retrospective

An opportunity for the Scrum Team to self-inspect and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next sprint. Usually chaired by the Scrum Master or a member of the team. Formats include Happy, Mad & Sad or KISS (Start, Stop, Continue & Improve). A set of agreeable actions formed.

## Sprint Planning

Time boxed session where the team agree to a set of deliverables (backlog items). The agreement defines the length of the sprint. Usually conducted by the Scrum Master or another member of the team, who facilitates clarification and acceptance criteria, team agrees on estimates.
The Key importance is ensuring sprint candidates meet the definition of ready. In the days leading sprint planning, the Product Owner identifies the items with the greatest value and work towards getting them to a ready state
-	Assign a Relative Story point
-	Define Acceptance Criteria
-	Meet [INVEST](http://wall-skills.com/2015/good-user-stories-are-invest/) criteria
It’s important to note the product backlog can include just about anything (new functionality, bugs and risks). Product Backlog Items (PBI’s) must be small enough to complete within a few days, if a story is considered too large, it should be split vertically (i.e. standalone) into smaller pieces.

## Additional techniques
Additional tasks such as velocity calculation and tracking can be considered as part of the session, to track the previous sprint's velocity and forward guide to planning the next sprint. It is a guide for stakeholders also to effectively gauge the performance of the sprint, and a measure to consider the amount of points to be allocated in the proceeding sprint

## Conclusion
The above is an insight into how a planning session can be broken down and carefully choreographed, to prove effective, and be executed in an appropriate time boxed manner.
