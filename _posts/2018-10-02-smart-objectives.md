## Preamble
The following describes an effective procedure that can be implemented as part of an individuals continued professional development (CPD) at CarFinance 247, implementing SMART objectives aligned with the company’s quarterly review practice.

## Introduction
At CarFinance 247, peers enter a round of quarterly reviews with line managers. The purpose of this is  reviewing and setting objectives, which are in place to identify, develop and promote an individual's skills set and/or to continue the improvement an existing skills set. Skills criteria can range from technical endeavors through to softer skills such as effective communications and leadership.

This blog will identify how to effectively achieve this through SMART objectives.

## What are SMART Objectives

SMART is a mnemonic term broken down to the following elements[1];

-	Specific – target a specific area for improvement.
-	Measurable – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.
-	Assignable – specify who will do it.
-	Realistic – state what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources.
-	Time-related – specify when the result(s) can be achieved.


Let’s examine each of the above terms and provide examples of each where it can be effectively described and implemented

**Specific**

In order to set an effective objective to an individual during a review, the objective needs to be specific, without the existence of a reasonable level of ambiguity. Consider the following objective;

> The individual will improve their leadership skills.

Compare this with the following altered version;

> The individual will improve their leadership skills, by chairing at
> least one sprint retrospective during the quarter.

**Measure**

In order to set an effective objective to an individual during a review, the objective needs to be specific, without the existence of a reasonable level of ambiguity. Consider the following objective;

> The individual will improve their development skills.

Compare this with the following altered version;

> The individual will improve their development skills, by implementing
> a suitable design pattern to an existing or new feature, resulting in
> the feature implementing SOLID principles, governed and integrated
> through a successful peer review(s).

**Assignable**

In order to set an effective objective to an individual during a review, the objective needs to be clear who is assignable the objective. Consider the following objective;

> The individual will become a Scrum Master.

Compare this with the following altered version;

> The individual will become a Scrum Master, by themselves organising,
> arranging and  escalating company financial assistance,  a suitable
> course followed by exam.

**Realistic**

> In order to set an effective objective to an individual during a
> review, the objective needs to realistically achievable, and not
> considered unreasonably outside the boundaries of the individual. It’s
> important to note, this may not necessarily be because of
> capabilities, and can be other constraints outside the control of the
> individual. Consider the following objective;

The individual will increase company profitability 10 fold through their contribution during the quarter.

Compare this with the following altered version;

> The individual will help drive company revenue and in turn profits,
> working with stakeholders, implementing features which will improve
> required criteria and targeting better performing applicants from our
> Cost Per Agreement (CPA) Partners.

**Time-Related**

> In order to set an effective objective to an individual during a
> review, the objective needs to realistically achievable, in this
> instance during the quarter. It’s also important to consider the
> inverse and not make the objective too short to achieve.

The individual will have a deep understanding of all the functionality present in all our squads in the department.

Compare this with the following altered version;

> The individual will become proficient in another squads implementation
> considerations and best practices, by attending it’s Product Ownership
> Group (POG) and/or Sprint planning sessions, and undertaking an action
> or follow up summary to an appropriate audience through a suitable
> medium.

## Conclusion
In Summary, the expected outcome of the objective has remained, with the added clarity of how it can be specifically achieved. The expectation and goals are clear to see, and can be effectively measured in terms of whether the outcome was achieved during the quarter.
