## Coming in from the dark side – why you don’t need to be techy to work within development
<!--more-->
My name’s Lucy and it has been 18 months since I have done a deal. The crowd at SA (Sales Anonymous) nod in acknowledgment.

So as you may have guessed, I am a Product Manager whose background has nothing to do with development or technology, but in fact from a sales and administrative background. Quite a career change!

My sales teams were in equal parts, sad, angry and confused when I told them I would be moving to work within the development team. Why would I want to voluntarily leave sales for development? Had I finally lost the plot? Had the pressure of sales got too much? I assume this is the same with all companies; as soon as an internal system fails everyone shouts bloody murder, “what have the ‘devs’ broke again” (sadly I was also one of these). So some of my team actually thought I was going over to be a mole for them, to stop them breaking sh*t.

Coming in to the development team from what I now refer to as the dark side (sales) was a shock to the system. I regularly asked myself in those first 3 months whether I had made the right decision, whether a career in development was the one for me and whether the business had made a huge mistake in granting me this opportunity. I felt I was constantly on the back foot and that I didn’t understand a thing my team were talking about in stand-ups and sprint planning - add onto this that with a team made up of 2 Irish, 1 Cypriot, 1 Hungarian and 1 Liverpudlian, things easily got lost in translation. I was leaving these meetings with a list of words written in my pad to go away and Google – I would not let them see me cry J

I regularly asked myself, with not having any knowledge or background in tech and dev, whether I would ever be able to fulfill the responsibilities of a Product Manager. Surely I must be able to code or SQL to be effective? The only card I held in my deck was my business knowledge, which actually turned out to be a major trump card (who knew?!)

My background in the business proved incredibly valuable to this role. I had been with the company for 4 years prior to joining the development team, having worked in 4 different areas over that time. This gave me a wide understanding of how the business operates. I knew what the business needed and knew all of the issues that users (employees) had when using the current system. When scoping out new features for my products, it allowed me to explain to the product team why certain things need to operate in certain ways, expanding both their business understanding and their confidence in what they are doing.

Another huge benefit from my non-tech background is the working relationships I have with different people across the business. They are comfortable talking to me and discuss issues they have, ideas for improvements, etc. I heard a term at a recent meet-up where it described Product Managers as ‘the acceptable face of technology’ and this truly strikes a chord with me. Employees across the business seem to be more receptive to training and releases of my team’s products – having the backing of internal users which will either use or promote your product is always beneficial and will help the product land and succeed.

I learnt that if you have confidence in your product and its functionality, what you are asking and why, all the rest is semantics – the technical stuff will eventually click and fall into place. No one is expecting you to be Linus Torvalds (yes I googled him). Every Product Manager brings different skills to the table and as long as you are willing to grow and learn along with your product, you should have a successful product to launch.

Sometimes you don’t have to be a dev, to be a dev!
